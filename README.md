# Rather Clever

Rather Clever is intended to be a fun game you can play with your friends. Users can create games that other users can join as players. Inside the game, players are encouraged to submit two options for a "Would you rather?" hypothetical question. Players can also view the would you rather submitted by other players in the game and vote on the two options. They can also vote on all the submitted questions on two superlatives. Funniest; for the funniest submitted question, and Most Ponderable; for the question that presented the toughest choice between the two options.

The back end of the app is built with Ruby-on-Rails, while the front end is built with React.
